<h4 class="subtitle">These Walls</h4>
<h4 style="margin-top: -15px" class="minutes-to-read">~ 11m ~</h4>

There is a time when the sky is lit but the city asleep when a hush fills this old apartment, complementing the dusty streaks of amber sunlight that leak through the slats over our windows. Then, slowly at first, the horns and cars and trains start up, and then all the noise comes at once. Mr. Sacofsky upstairs uses a walker; his lonely shuffling provides the percussion to the constant fighting from the young couple next door. Staccato improvisation rises from the yelling of the Goldsteins’ children who live in their family apartment below. When we decided to move to Manhattan, Sophia and I envisioned a place of our own to claim and raise our flag. We both wanted the tiny New York apartment with the mattress on the floor and the unpacked boxes everywhere. We fell in love with a fantasy. In truth, we were just tired of dealing with separate places, roommates, and cleaning dirty dishes we didn’t make. So, when the time came for a change, we opted for a downtown apartment and moved in together. We had to pay for our privacy, and were willing to pay New York City prices for New York City privacy: paper-thin walls; tiny rooms; and barely enough left over from paychecks to keep the fridge stocked. Our first night in the apartment we lay in bed, our lamps on the hardwood floors, our boxes in piles, and tried to sleep. Between Mr. Sacofsky and the young couple and the Goldsteins’ kids we were fighting a cacophony. The 4 passed by so close it shook the room. We laughed at it all until we finally fell asleep.

But tonight, this late, there is no noise. Mr. Sacofsky and the Goldstein children have long since been asleep, the hour is closer to when they rise than when they fall. And it’s too late for the young couple to be fighting. Their anger is depleted for the day. They’re too tired not to fall back to a bed of tangled limbs and complacency, dreaming of new ways to fight for tomorrow. There is no Sophia, either. There won’t be a Sophia after tonight, but I can’t know that yet. Right now, I’m standing just outside the apartment door with the key in the lock, only I can’t bring myself to turn the handle because every time I reach for it I see the black streaks on my hands and I start to cry. I’ve been out here for twenty minutes silent, staring at that damn doorknob as I weep. Tonight, there is no noise. There is no Sophia. There is only the occasional car, the black streaks on my hands, and the smell of kerosene. 

I finally get inside. I make it five steps into the kitchen before I get sick, and that’s when Sophia tries to sneak into the apartment quietly behind me. That’s how she finds me tonight, for our last night – bent over the sink heaving and crying. I’m gasping for air but all I swallow are fumes. I shut my eyes but all I see are flames. The tap opens and I drop my head into the sink, letting the rush of the water drown out my thoughts. But I still smell the kerosene. I still hear the screaming. What I can hardly hear is Sophia trying to talk to me. From the past few months of late-night excuses I can put together her lie du jour from memory.

“Zeke, they kept me late at work again because of – oh my god, are you drunk?”

I open my mouth to speak, to tell her about my stepfather, to tell her about the trial and Gabe, but all that comes out is bile. 

“Jesus, Zeke, what is that smell? Is that gasoline? Did you leave the stove on?”

Her heels click across tile as she checks the stovetop. I turn off the tap.

“It’s kerosene.”

I open my eyes and realize the lights in the kitchen are on. Sophia must have flipped the switch when she came in. I’m drowning in the waves of my distorted vision. The nausea subsides to accommodate the growing pit in my stomach as I stand up. She’s dressed like she used to when we first started going out. I haven’t seen her like this in months. She’s telling me how hard it’s been lately, how distant I’ve been. All I hear is the cackling flames and the screaming. She’s angry now, yelling at me. She’s asking if I even care and if I’ve even been listening when she sees the blood on my pants. They must have torn when we climbed the fence. The whirling flame of her growing dissatisfaction extinguishes in a single breath.

“Oh god, are you okay?”

She puts her hands on my shoulders and I look down, watching my tears quietly fall to the floor. She’s whispering in my ear, asking what’s wrong, asking what’s happening.

In a younger life we went out to a bar one night with our friends, as we did most weekends. The air was thick with a warmth and comfort and, as we left, I felt myself begin to break. We stopped on the sidewalk next to a brick wall and the words began to spill out of my mouth. I told her about my stepfather, the sexual abuse allegations, and the trial. About how for seven years I slept down the hall as my own goddamn sister lived in torture and I didn’t do anything and I couldn’t see it. She held me and kept my chin up, my eyes fixed on her. “You’re a good person,” she said, “this is not your fault.” She held me as I cried and gasped for air, and I clung to her; my only concrete grasp on a world that was falling out beneath my feet. She whispered Portuguese in my ear as she stroked my hair. <em>Relaxo</em>. <em>Tranquilo</em>. I couldn’t understand what she was saying, only the comfort in her voice. I like to think she tried out saying things to me for the first time in Portuguese to see how they made her feel before committing to them in English. She felt the weight of my world that night. She felt it tremble as it crumbled apart, bit-by-bit.
Months after when it was just Gabe and I and we were drunk and breaking down the way old friends do, his face got serious. I told him the same story I told Sophia, and how now my stepfather lived with a new family with a young daughter. He gripped my shoulders tight and told me he’d paid his dues with the right people. He told me if I wanted to, we could pay him a visit, but that I had to be sure it was something I wanted. When the time came, I could tell him to his face it was what I wanted and we could go. He left it at a vague rolling plan, the kind I used my imagination to fill in for the months of nights that followed. And when the trial ended in two days and my stepfather got off free, I met Gabe and told him it was what I wanted.

“Zeke, talk to me. <em>Meu amor</em>, talk to me. What is it?”

I can’t look her in the eyes. I can’t hear what she has to say. All I see are the flames. All I hear is the screaming. All I smell is the kerosene.

When we moved here, we were strangers in a strange land. From across the river we’d left our space and security for a decaying fantasy. But tonight as Sophia holds me for the last time before I tell her what I’ve done, I realize that we do belong here. These walls tell the stories of the heartbreak of Mr. Sacofsky and his dearly departed wife, of the pounding young love next door wrapped in a thin layer of the tumultuous stresses of an economic recession, of the Goldsteins beneath us fending off the world’s evils for their children. These apartments are no more than little boxes of a compartmentalized American dream, a fractured prism of light that scatters who we want to be and who we are and flings them at opposite ends where once they were together, where once they were the same. Tonight, these walls will talk of Sophia and Zeke for one last time in the present, before relegating us to the archives of those who came and went before us. Tonight, in the darkness and the silence, we are alone; our regulated symphony of dysfunction exchanged for Sophia’s comforting words, my shallow breaths, and the whispers of these walls.
