Hello from Bangkok, Thailand! I've travelled 29 hours flying to get all the way out here from Boston, MA (though, to me, it seemed like 49: 6am to midnight the next night). Welcome to the beautiful, daunting, multi-faceted, home-for-two-months, Kingdom of Thailand! It took some casual Googling for the King in Kingdom to really slap me across the face. The Thai tend to [take their monarch quite, quite seriously](http://goseasia.about.com/od/thaipeopleculture/a/lesemajeste.htm). Unlike our English cousins, the Thai have a working monarchy, and you're reminded of this fact from the public shrines to the King's family, to standing in a train station in honor of the King, to sitting through a video montage propaganda film before a movie! Other big no-nos in Thailand involve the Buddha and monks, you're not allowed to bring back any imagery of the Buddha (especially tattoos, something Western travellers are apparently frequently guilty of).

After my first long (long... looooong) plane ride, I arrived in the Tokyo Narita airport. It was my first "time" in Japan (as much as the airport counts), and it made me exceptionally excited for the 9-hour layover I have planned there on the return flight... on September 4th. That's probably when it hit first that I'm going to be gone for a long time (seven weeks). 

I tried my hardest to stay awake on the 8-hour flight to Bangkok from Tokyo in order to adjust, but failed miserably. Arriving groggy and half brain-dead, I grabbed some noodles and Chang (what would become my least favorite Thai beer) and hopped in a taxi to head to the hostel my sister Julia recommended me: Saphipae Backpacker's Hostel. Even without a reservation arriving at close to 3 a.m. I was fine, and twenty minutes later I was asleep, ready for the next day to begin. 

But instead of recount my daily schedule this past week, I decided to use this post to describe my top 10 most interesting things I've seen while in Bangkok:
