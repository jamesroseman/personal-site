Hello from Bangkok, Thailand! I've travelled 29 hours flying to get all the way out here from Boston, MA (though, to me, it seemed like 49: 6am to midnight the next night). Welcome to the beautiful, daunting, multi-faceted, home-for-two-months, Kingdom of Thailand! It took some casual Googling for the King in Kingdom to really slap me across the face. The Thai tend to [take their monarch quite, quite seriously](http://goseasia.about.com/od/thaipeopleculture/a/lesemajeste.htm). Unlike our English cousins, the Thai have a working monarchy, and you're reminded of this fact from the public shrines to the King's family, to standing in a train station in honor of the King, to sitting through a video montage propaganda film before a movie! Other big no-nos in Thailand involve the Buddha and monks, you're not allowed to bring back any imagery of the Buddha (especially tattoos, something Western travellers are apparently frequently guilty of).

After my first long (long... looooong) plane ride, I arrived in the Tokyo Narita airport. It was my first "time" in Japan (as much as the airport counts), and it made me exceptionally excited for the 9-hour layover I have planned there on the return flight... on September 4th. That's probably when it hit first that I'm going to be gone for a long time (seven weeks). 

I tried my hardest to stay awake on the 8-hour flight to Bangkok from Tokyo in order to adjust, but failed miserably. Arriving groggy and half brain-dead, I grabbed some noodles and Chang (what would become my least favorite Thai beer) and hopped in a taxi to head to the hostel my sister Julia recommended me: Saphaipae Backpacker's Hostel. Even without a reservation arriving at close to 3 a.m. I was fine, and twenty minutes later I was asleep, ready for the next day to begin. 

I spent my first few days becoming accustomed to my new home for the next seven weeks, and learned a lot about Bangkok and travel in general:

1. All hail the favorable exchange rate

The Thai use the THB (Thai baht) and, at the time of writing this, it's about 33 to 1 USD. That means 100 THB is about 3 USD. You can get a large 1.5L bottle of water (important when the tap isn't potable) for about 25 THB usually. A meal will run you anywhere from 50-150 THB depending on budget, size, and proclivity to street food (it's amazing here). Strangely, most prices are pretty uniform across the city. In my five days in Bangkok, I started using a restaurant's pricing of Chang (Thai beer) as a standard -- anything over 60 THB for a small bottle was out of my price-range. 

2. Getting around

In Bangkok there are a few main routes of travel for the casual tourist: tuk-tuks (which **will** rip you off if you let them by taking you to places you don't want to go); taxis (which **will** rip you off if you don't state a set price or urge them to use the meter strongly); motorcycle taxi (look for the men in orange vests sitting on scooters by the road, they can take you anywhere for a cheap price, just watch your legs for the exhaust; and Skytrain (which I fell in love with). My hostel (Saphaipae, highly recommend) was right next to a Skytrain stop, so when I wanted to get somewhere fast, cheaply, and conveniently, I just hopped on. 

3. Roooxxxxannne

Bangkok has red-light districts. They are huge. They are fierce. The setting sun is an ember blown to life by neon-lights, and every night the districts light up in flames of debauchery. They're a sight to see, and if you're in Bangkok for a few nights they're definitely worth at least one (whether or not you go to a ping-pong show is at your discretion...). 

If party-going is your scene, but you're not so much into the peep show sight seeing, be sure to walk the well-worn Khao Son Road at night and party with your fellow tourists. I saw a friend of mine out and we went to Khao Son for his last night. A few buckets, towers, and fried scorpions later, Khao Son spit us out on stoops eating 50 THB pad thai (that was honestly phenomenal). 

4. The Wats

Wats (a Thai Buddhist temple) are extremely important in Buddhist culture in Thailand (you'll often see people bowing or wai to them on the streets or in taxis). I'm putting up some pictures to share, but Wat Saket was my favorite. You climb some 350-stairs to get to a great view of the city, and ring bells and gongs on the way up for good luck. It was at Wat Saket that I got my first Western traveller experience of taking a photo with a Chinese tourist. We were next to a historic Wat, but she just wanted a picture with me. Eat your heart out, Saket.

5. The Ghost Tower

In the 1990s, a businessman in Thailand was in the process of building two large skyscrapers on the very popular (and populated) Sathorn Rd in Bangkok when the 1997 Asian economic collapse happened. With investors pulling out, he refocused efforts on completing just one of the towers, leaving the other to decay in a state of half-finished glory. It's a popular destination for adventerous tourists because of the views you can get from the top (imagine a 77-story hotel without external walls). Unfortunately, since a suicide and several other recent tourist deaths, the manager decided to sell the building and it's illegal to climb. Not even bribes can get you through, and even if you get on the property there are new metal gates blocking the stairs. Not that I know anything about that...

That's all for now, I'm headed off to the islands to get a good taste of the party-going cultureless tourist lifestyle that haunts parts of the Gulf islands: Ko Samui, Ko Tao, and the infamous Ko Phangan. I have a ticket for an overnight train tonight to go to Ko Phangan, but I'm considering getting off early to head to Ko Tao to meet a Bangkok friend... I'll keep you updated!
