"Haad Rin Fighting Arena! Professional Muay Thai fights!" The disembodied voice croons in a thick smooth Thai from a rusted loudspeaker next to the faded arena sign. Some old 80s pop song with a boyish aderenaline-fueled heartbeat like "The Final Countdown" provides the backdrop for the automated announcement. "Fights start at 9! Come on time... and bring your friends!"

I think I notice their faces first. Dutch, French, Spanish, shock transcends the language and cultural barriers that dictate facial expression. We stand outside of the Siam clinic in a big semi-circle, enveloping it. Stage left are three Thai girls crumpled in one another's arms, wailing and taking turns comforting and being comforted. Stage right are nurses and doctors frantically pumping away at the chest of a Thai man, naked except for a modest towel draped over his waist. I can't tell which we watch more fervently. 

An ambo wails over the hill and comes into sight. A German man snaps into action, clearing the street in slightly affected English. "Get back! Move along!" He acts like I imagine my father would act, or like I hope I would. I want to take every spectator by the shoulders and say "dammit those are people in there!" but instead I stay. A Vietnamese tourist takes out his phone to film the man being moved into the ambo before an Austrian woman shames him into putting away.

The ambo clears out and the crowd, starved of entertainment, aimlessly disbands. We are partyguests who have stayed just minutes too long and seen the domestic dispute, doomed to walk until the shock fades off. The street empties, except for the three Thai girls, now crumpled against the wall next to the clinic moaning for their friend. 

I like to think we were standing there in case any of us found the bravery to do what he did and help the situation. But a bit like running to jump into a lake only to see the drop too early, we were left teetering on the edge, out of place and entirely too cowardly to be progress or return. Maybe violence isn't a cultural phenomenal but a naturally-occuring one, the subtone to an ethos that lives just below audible frequency, a necessity of the natural order. Maybe we breath it in through the air and drink it in through our pores and repress it, where it waits for a dying man to come into to view to beat our chest and root our feet and flush our cheeks. 

I find myself back in front of the Haad Rin fight arena sign, noticing for the first time how young the fighters really are. 

"Come on time... and bring your friends!"
