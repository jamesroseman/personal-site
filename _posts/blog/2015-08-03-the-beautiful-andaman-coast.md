Phew... what a week.

For those who don't know, Thailand is a particularly strange shaped country. Through conquests and wars, the Thai people inhabit a land with a fat meaty midsection and a long skinny tail that competes all the way down the Andaman coast with Myanmar. Off the coast of this Andaman Coast, there are islands and small waterfront tourist towns to both the east and west. On the west lies Krabi, Phuket, Ko Phi Phi, and my ultimate regret Ko Lanta (supposed to be a little respite from the tourist game). To the east lies the Tourist Trifecta of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan, and Ko Tao (as you can probably tell by now, Ko means "island" in Thai).

The tourist trap areas exist (like many parts of Thailand) solely on tourist money. That means both that there is a striking lack of culture, and that there are a surprising amount of tourists. Phuket, Ko Phi Phi, Ko Samui, and Ko Pha Ngan are all particularly touristy. If you're planning a trip there, keep in mind you'll be seeing a lot of familiar farang ("foreigner" or "white person" in Thai) faces there. If you're after a more relaxed experience away from the crowds, you might try your luck in Krabi, Ko Lanta (oh my sweet regret...), or Ko Tao!

Background setting aside, let's continue the story as it left off. I spent my last night in Bangkok with a new friend on the infamous Khao Son Road, then we went in the morning to the Chatuchak market. I might write a short post solely on that experience, as it was a crazy adventure, but for now I'll fast forward to getting to the Hua Lamphong train station in Bangkok, preparing to go south. My original plan was to stay on the east coast for a few nights, then hop over to Krabi and Ko Lanta to see the west coast as well.

I arrive at the large imposing Hua Lamphong train station just as the King's Anthem is being played. I saw this in Bangkok during the 4DX showing of Ant Man, but frequently in Thailand they'll play the national anthem and all will rise everywhere for the King. If you're headed to the Kingdom of Thailand and you see people stopping to stand up, follow suit just to be safe. 

I hopped on the overnight sleeper train from Bangkok to Surat Thani, which is where the ferry/bus combo leaves from to get to Ko Pha Ngan. My plan was to go to Ko Pha Ngan, Ko Tao, and then over to the west coast. There were a few boys from London travelling together to Ko Tao on the train who implored me to consider visitng Ko Tao for a few nights and then heading to Ko Pha Ngan for the debaucherous Full Moon Party. With no concrete plans, I agreed, and told them to wake me up whenever they got off. That's how I wound up at Ko Tao instead of Ko Pha Ngan... and how I stayed for five nights there...

Ko Tao is how I imagine paradise. My room was 300 THB ($9) a night. Almost every morning I was there I'd get up, go rent a motorcycle and explore, and end the day with a cold Singha Thai beer watching the sunset over the ocean. The view, the price, and the natural surroundings of the large imposing green monstrous mountains all combined to make Ko Tao my favorite place I've been in a long time. Additionally, it's tiny. It takes about fifteen minutes to travel by motorbike (or flashy red-and-gold Grom) to get from one side of the island to the other. If you're headed there, be sure to check out the Natural High Cafe for a killer view, and make a trip out of riding up to Lookout Pt and then down to Mango Bay. It's a long almost vertical dirt and rock road, but well worth it for the view. Ko Tao means "turtle island" because, like all of the islands of the Gulf coast, it's a largely mountainous island with lush green carpet of trees that cascade through peaks and valleys -- resembling a turtle. I believe the real reason is because time feels slowed on the island. Even now writing this after the fact I feel like someone desperately trying to explain a dream they had. The emotional echoes resonate through my memories of the place, but it feels hazy like it might not have happened at all. For the $1 mango lassis I enjoyed while watching the sunset, I wouldn't have been surprised at all if it had all been just a bit too good to be true.

As it turns out, people make plans to go to Full Moon Party weeks and weeks in advance. What this meant practically was that I had no place to stay on the 31st and 1st, when the Full Moon Party takes place. Enter Joel Eriksson, a Swedish cop I met outside my hostel eating street food. We got to talking, and he invited me to share his bungalow that's on Haad Rin beach (the party beach for FMP) for only 300 THB a night. People pay upwards of 1000 THB to stay on Haad Rin during the party, so I couldn't refuse. And that's the story of how two nights later I found myself on a beach packed with 5,000 farangs covered in neon-paint enjoying drinks out of buckets and watching people skip rope while the rope was **on fire**. It was a wild experience, and I'm glad I went, but there's a reason after sleeping off the night the next morning I got out of the south as fast as possible. 

The islands are beautiful and majestic, and my time there was extremely relaxing after the hectic city life of Bangkok. In all, I felt guilty wasting trip time on tropical paradise that honestly could have been anywhere, and I decided to leave. If I had more time, or weren't burning through an extremely gracious parental graduation present (see also: someone else's money), I could imagine staying for weeks if not months doing the same thing on Ko Tao everyday and never getting bored. Many of the ex-pat diving instructors (Ko Tao is the cheapest place to get PADI scuba certified) did exactly that in fact -- came for a week and stayed for the rest of their lives. 

So, after eight nights, I shook the sand out of my sandals and took a ferry/bus combo back to Surat Thani to catch a bus to Bangkok. Next stop... Northern Thailand!
