Nestled in a valley in the foothills of lush green mountatains, Pai sits just 55 miles northwest of Chiang Mai, a hippie paradise embedded in nature. It's almost unfair how picturesque Pai really is, everywhere you look is a postcard waiting to be photographed, printed, and stamped. Thinking of you from the beautiful Pai!

I'm unsure of the exact history of Pai, but from people I've spoken to it used to be extremely quaint and quiet -- the kind of place where you really wouldn't find many tourists. As the secret spot became better known, the tourist industry caught up with the demand and now resorts are a common sight on the outskirt of the town. But the town proper is still rich with its hippie-laden historical blood. 

Pai is centered around two main roads, meaning you'll run into almost everyone you know in Pai at some point of being there. It also means renting a scooter is a must. There's something so wondrously childish about zooming around a small town with a big group of new friends on scooters. There are delicious vegan restaurants, beautiful canyons, rushing waterfalls, caves, and even a large white Buddha that sits atop the nearest mountain to Pai overlooking the entire town. As you look around, it becomes extremely easy to see why so many foreigners come to Pai for two days and stay for two weeks. Accomodation is extremely cheap and social (I paid 350 THB -- $13 -- for two nights staying in a dorm), everyone is very nice, and it's very easy to get around. 

Pai has something for everyone. Where Ko Tao excelled in island life and hikes, Pai offers nature to explore and hike in, a wonderfully quaint night market to explore for shopping, great restaurants that came with the tourism boom, and temples for the more culturally minded. Even those who want a more comfortable stay (see also: Westernized resort experience) will find places to go and more touristy treks and guided tours to do.

I only spent two nights in the town of Pai and if I didn't have Angkor Wat waiting to be explored before my Vietnam journey (with Sarah!), then I'd probably stay for two weeks, if not years. At the Purple Monkey, where I stayed, they offered free accomodation and a meal if you did odd-jobs around the place like painting tables and cleaning up. It didn't take me long to fantasize about staying for weeks and not paying a dime except for the occasional shake at the psychedelically fun Sunset Bar. I'd shirk all my duties, post up in a hostel, and only send word to let the world know I'd found a new home. Thinking of you from beautiful Pai, with love, James.
