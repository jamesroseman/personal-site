<h4 class="subtitle">Yard Sale</h4>
<h4 class="minutes-to-read">~ 2m ~</h4>

Jasper lingered at the table of old dolls, holding one. Touching its porcelain cheek, he felt moved to a different place, not too long ago, when Lilly might have been there beside him. He wondered where she was today. She loved old garage sales. He thought she did. He had thought she loved him, too.

There wasn’t much for sale, and most of it was old kids’ stuff. The seller stood vacantly near a table of old how-to-read books. His white shirt looked a little lived in. His eyes looked heavy on his face. He watched Jasper handle the old doll intently. Fearfully.  Jasper saw an old record player on the table in front of the seller.

He had to put away his box of records because Lilly hated the clutter. He saw his father’s gifts to him as a sort of legacy. She had seen them as a mess. He hated her then, at that moment, for not being able to understand.

He crossed the driveway and picked the player up, looking for a price sticker.

“Excuse me, how much for this?”

The man’s eyes fixed on the toy.

“It says here fifteen dollars. How about ten?”

He didn’t say anything right away. He nodded. His eyes watered, and Jasper could feel them gaze through him, far away. Jasper shoved a crumpled twenty in his hand, which closed mechanically. With muttered thanks, Jasper walked away. 
The man stood frozen, staring at the spot where Jasper had stood.

	This piece was done for Michael Downing's 2013 Spring Fiction course taught at Tufts University. The objective of this exercise was to explore inference. The required setting of this short story was at some type of yard sale, where the vendor was selling the personal affects of a recently departed child. The child's death was to be "felt, but not explicitly stated" through the interactions between the vendor and a buyer. Word limit: 250 words (248 words).
