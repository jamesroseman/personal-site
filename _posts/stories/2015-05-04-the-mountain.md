<h4 class="minutes-to-read">~ 28m ~</h4>

“I can’t do this anymore where we spend a night together like we’re married and in love and then not talk for days. I know you care about me. You know I care about you too. But I also know I can bury it. I’d rather that than be hurt.” 

I hear the phone static as Kat waits for me to speak, but I don’t say anything. 

“If this is what we’re doing, fine, then let me know. I can’t go around caring more about this than you do. But you’ve heard this before. Make a decision and stick to it. All or nothing, Jack.”

Another pause and then, right before the click, I know I hear her voice start to break. This is the last time I’ll ever hear from Kat.

It’s about a year ago I meet her at a party. It’s a birthday party or maybe a work thing but suddenly, there she is. I want to talk to her more than I want to think about the girlfriend at home in our apartment alone.

She comes up to about my shoulders, a little taller than Ana. Her hair comes down in waves. My father would say she’d even make a good looking corpse, but we never did share the same sense of humor. She’s guarded and I see her eyes go steely. I almost don’t say anything at all. 

She’s a painter. She sells landscapes she hates to clients she doesn’t know through a gallery her mother owns. It isn’t much, but enough for rent and supplies. I ask her why she does it at all and she tells me it was so she could work on the paintings she does want to paint. She never sells those ones. She never even shows them to anyone. Those were her honest paintings, the ones that she put herself into, she said. And in order to be honest, you have to be vulnerable.

The party starts winding down. I’m working my way to asking if she wants to get some food together when she interrupts me. “Let’s get out of here.” She eyes me carefully as she says it, and pairs the look with an impish smile. She was always so clearly in control.

It’s colder outside than she’s dressed for, so I offer her my coat. 

“Won’t you be cold?”

“I’ll manage.”

We walk down a main stretch of road as cars zoom by. I watch the drivers as they pass, their faces illuminated by the colored displays inside their cars. An orange face of a man heading home from a long shift. A blue grin. A green frown. The houses we pass imitate their smiles and frowns with shadows cast by the streetlights. 

Kat looks around at it all as she walks next to me. Her shoes click on the pavement. Her lips are drawn tight. I enjoy our silence. Her fingers play with the stitching on the coat, pulling it closer around her shoulders. When we get to the place we pick a booth and I order the food, I tell her to trust me on it. She says we don’t know each other nearly well enough to be eating together. I play along and agree, but tell her she has to ask the first question.

“What are you most afraid of?”

My father comes to mind. I’m back in that room. I can’t keep my eyes from being empty as I say, “spiders, you?” She eyes me before responding.

“I’ve always wanted to be great. I guess I’m most afraid of losing ambition.”

“What do you mean, you mean famous?”

“More than that. I want to own something so completely – maybe it’s just the idea of being self-assured in a concrete way. I want to be that artist jetted across the globe to galleries and openings – I feel like it’d say something about my value, you know?”

“Doesn’t that make you a little self-obsessed?”

“Aren’t we all? Everything you do is about you, right? I think the question isn’t the existence of people’s self-obsession so much as it’s whether or not they’re aware of it.”

There’s a line between headstrong and patronizing, and Kat dances it with every emphatic consonant and half-smile.

“I don’t know, what about charity?”

“I think the kind of people who do charity feel good doing it.”

She pauses, organizing her thoughts before she lets them out. Her hands dance to her words.

“I think either you recognize that what you’re doing is for yourself or you don’t. The only difference to me between selfish and self-aware is whether or not you get what you really want.”

“So what is it that you really want?”

The man behind the counter yells out my name to pick up the tray of food. She looks through me and smiles, liking what she sees, before shooing me to go get the food. My face flushes with heat.

I wake up back at the apartment with Ana. Her arm is draped across my chest and the other folded underneath her. She feels so small against me. I wonder all that I’ve done to her. 
When we started dating Ana used to give me this look like she couldn’t tell if I had all the answers or if I was just full of it. She’d laugh at all my bad dopey jokes and throw her arms around me for no reason all the time. I had to be careful in kitchens with knives because of the way she’d come up behind me and wrap her arms around my waist and kiss my neck. She'd linger then and we’d hold each other in those moments.

One hot summer night when we were both at our hometown we went to this old beach we’d grown up near. She started stripping and told me matter-of-factly that we were going skinny dipping. I jumped into the waves after her and we just stood there. The moon was full and the water was full of splinters of its light. We kissed and stayed for a while, listening to the waves.
After Ana caught me cheating with some girl from a bar, we fought for weeks. Every time I told her she might be happier without me she’d scream, asking if I was really going to just give up on everything we’d built together. It started slowly after that.

Her satisfaction decayed to complacency. I think she always wanted me to change and show her I wasn’t the man who would sleep with bar floozy, but I was. That man who slept around was the same man that night in the water was the same man she fell for years ago. Her mistake was thinking I’d ever changed at all.

I slip under her arm and go to take a shower. My phone has a new message from an unknown phone number that just says, “Let’s do tonight again.”

<p style="text-align: center">

</p>

Thursdays are movie nights, vestiges of a happier relationship. I pick up popcorn and ice cream and Ana picks out a movie and we sit back and watch. It’s relaxing. 

But this Thursday I cut out for the bar. I’m feeling confident until I see Kat walk in. She doesn’t say anything, but the little turned up corners of her mouth tell me I did okay with the place. 

That night she invites me up for the first time, her flatmates aren’t home. Noises from the taxis and streetcars drift through her open window. Her room is small for how much she pays for it, city prices. It can hardly fit her mattress and her wardrobe. Somehow she manages to make it feel regal.

Afterwards, we lie in her bed staring at the off-white slanted ceiling. Her bed has some of the softest sheets I know, I prefer hers to mine. Her room is decorated sparsely with framed photographs and some canvases. Her fingers trace patterns absentmindedly across my bare chest as we talk. 

Paintings sit against the wall across from the bed. They alternate between paintings of mountains and of ocean waves, but always the same view. There’s a pointillism mountain range next to an abstract set of waves next to a realist mountain range next to red waves. The last painting in the series isn’t finished; the large blotches of unpainted canvas are struck with red swipes. I ask Kat about the paintings and she says she has this recurring dream where she has to choose between running to the mountains or the sea, but can never decide. Every time she has the dream she does a painting.

“I dated a boy from college, Mike, for about five years until last spring. That was my last relationship. Since then it’s been…” she gestures vaguely around the room, “flings, I guess.”

She doesn’t look at me as she speaks; her eyes stay on the ceiling.

“I don’t really see anyone for that long anymore, it’s hard for me.”

She says it like she’s quoting something. 

“At night I like to stay up with earplugs in and just sketch. It’s too late for the subway to rumble the building, and all my flatmates are asleep. Nobody is trying to reach me. It’s just me and my work, and for a few hours I’m perfectly alone. Life just gets so loud sometimes.”
We have these kinds of conversations almost every night we spend together. She says these thoughts that feel so heavy you just have to let them hang in the air for a little while and dissipate.

“Don’t you get lonely?”

She bites the inside of her lips and doesn’t turn to me. Her eyes do this thing where they dart left and right quickly a few times before refocusing straight on when she thinks.

“I do sometimes. But most times I feel more lonely when I’m with people.” She looks over at me and smiles, “Most times.”

My father used to tell me that the only way to deal with a woman was in short bursts. Spend too much time with them and you’ll go crazy. He died alone in a retirement home, bitter and angry. I visited him once a week until one week I didn’t have to anymore.

I remember the first time my father hit me. I was twelve and he was drunk. He heard me crying from the hall, and started banging on my closed door. My lock didn’t hold against his kick, and my grip on the bedframe didn’t hold when he threw me against the wall. 

I think I had known for years my mother would leave us. I really don’t think my father had ever guessed it. He always liked to drink, but the way he hit it after she left made me think he was completely blindsided. Night after night he’d blame me between drunken swings to the face.

The first and only time I brought a girl home my father looked her up and down and declared her a skank to her face. He was halfway through his drunken tirade when she left crying.

Kat never asks why I could only see her certain nights, but she’s not stupid. She’s away on a family vacation for two weeks, Ana and I are on one of our good streaks.
We have music we used to listen to in high school on the speakers. A bottle of wine sits half-empty on the counter, and we haven’t even finished cooking yet. We’re having our first good time in months. Ana had heard about this recipe from someone at work, so she decided we’d try it out and cook together, like we used to. The apartment smells like contentment. 

Ana gets silly when she gets happy, and it’s contagious. She dances across the kitchen floor with a goofy grin on her face towards me. She’s shorter than Kat, and a little more stout, but with good strong legs. I’m trying to test Kat’s theories on Ana, I blame it on this guy Frankie who I work with, and tell her he’s taking a philosophy class.

“Like there’s this idea that it doesn’t matter what your intention is, ultimately you do what you do because it benefits you. Like eating or drinking or”, I gesture around, “cooking, you know?”

“What about like charity, though? All that stuff?”

“That’s what I said! Frankie said ‘people who don’t get something out of doing that kind of work don’t do it,’ or something like that.”

“I don’t know, it sounds kind of sick to me. What, so suddenly there’s no good people? We’re all just self-obsessed jerks? People don’t just do charity because it’s fun.”

“No no, not because it’s fun, because they –”

“Yeah, I get it Jack, because they ‘get something out of it’ or whatever. It’s just, maybe Frankie should spend more time at his desk, you know? I’m pretty sure he wasn’t hired to think.”

She laughs in a way I’m not supposed to find funny.

“That’s not the point… Well, okay, what do you think then?”

“Think about what?”

“About self-interest, if everything you do is in self-interest.”

“I hope the chicken isn’t burning. What? Oh, I don’t know, Jack.”

I give it a second of silence and hope she finds that goofy happiness she was holding onto when she left it. 

Ana throws her arms around me. I hold her and look down at that American face, with her tiny ears that hold her hair back as it drapes down. She’s never been guarded with me, but always prepared to be let down. Everyone in her life has, why wouldn’t I? It’s what makes it so gratifying to come through for her, and so heartbreaking to come short. In one disappointed look you’re relegated to an archive of disappointing figures in her life. I kiss her and wish we could travel back before the fights and Kat and all the others to that beach where we were only ourselves and only perfection. The timer rings and it’s time to take the chicken out of the oven.

“Liz from work was telling me about this recipe, it’s actually supposed to be really good! You might even like it.” I almost see a hint of my favorite look buried in her eyes, but as if she realizes it she blinks and it’s gone. 

“I’m sure I’ll love it.”

She takes the chicken out and hugs me again. I feel the buzzing of my phone in my pocket, and Ana feels it too. The caller ID says “Joe from Work”. I told Kat not to call me. I decline the call and look back up to Ana whose face has fallen. She’s smarter than that.

“Oh shoot, Joe told me he needed to talk to me about a work thing tonight. Let me call him back, babe, it’ll only take a second.”

She goes back to cutting up carrots and doesn’t respond. I hear her change the music as I step into the bedroom.

“Kat, I thought I told you not to call.”

Her dad’s sick, or maybe it’s her brother. I hear her cry for the first time and know I need to be there. I say something quick and vague to Ana and step outside before the words sink in. I hear the music turn off from outside of the door as I leave.

Kat empties herself into a growing pile of tissues. I catch bits of what’s happening between the heaves. Her father had an accident on a work trip out in Colorado. Her mother had flown out in the morning, but they couldn’t afford to close the gallery. She was confident her father would be okay, so Kat didn’t protest not going. When her mother arrived, they told her he had gotten an infection or a parasite or something. It didn’t look good.

“He’s a great man to have raised a daughter like you.”

She sniffles and looks at me, raising an arm to stroke my face.

“If I could have just met you at a different time, or a different life.”

We sit there for a while until she starts to talk, mostly about her father and what it was like growing up with him. He had been screwed out of a few big business deals that had left their family in big financial trouble. 

“My ex, Mike, abused me for the last two years of our relationship. I couldn’t do anything right by him. We couldn’t go to the same school, so I couldn’t do anything outside of classes without worrying about upsetting him. Towards the end he gave me a black eye the same week we were talking about moving in together after graduation. I finally went home to my father, but I was scared. I told him about Mike and my dad was just there for me. I don’t know what he said or what he did but the next morning there was a box on the front step with all my stuff from Mike’s. I never heard from him again. I don’t know what I’d do without him.”

That night I have a dream I’m in a stretch of land between a mountain range and a raging ocean. I’m panicked and running into the mountains. I feel the heat before I see that the entire range is engulfed in flame. I turn back to go to the ocean but I’m suddenly surrounded on all sides. I start to run and the dirt gives out beneath my feet and the last thing I feel before I wake up is the fall into emptiness.

Kat clutches me like I’m the only thing that matters in the thick darkness, and I duck out of her apartment before she wakes up.

When I was seventeen, I tried to go to my senior prom with Ana. Her parents, meaning well, called ahead to see what my father wanted to do about pictures and whether or not I could stay over at their house (“separate beds – we promise!”). Ana’s parents loved me, apparently all the boys before me were a little unstable. Clean cut Jack came in and swept them away. I had a plan for my future, good grades, and hair that ended before my shoulders.

When my dad found out I was planning on going he got meaner than I’d ever seen him. It was the first time I thought he might actually kill me. I wasn’t that twelve year-old boy anymore, I was on my way to becoming a man. I don’t think he realized that when I ducked one of his swings and hit back. He stood there for a second before throwing me into the bathroom and locking the door. Ana spent prom night waiting for a ride that didn’t come. There are days I still close my eyes and see that darkness and hear his voice. When they buried him they kept warning me, “dead, but never forgotten."

<p style="text-align: center">
	<i class="fa fa-asterisk stories-pagebreak"></i>
</p>

When I get back home from Kat’s, I find Ana asleep on the couch. I wake her up and lead her back to bed, telling her all about how Joe from work got kicked out by his girlfriend and yes, he was the depressed one I was telling her about. Yes, he’s okay now, and I’m sorry I couldn’t call, my phone was dead. Yes, I should have charged it, let’s go back to bed. The sheets form peaks and valleys around her face. Before she drifts back to sleep her face crumples and she looks up at me from under the sheets with no anger, just resignation. “Don’t treat me like I’m stupid, Jack. I’m not stupid. I just… I can’t do this without you. I don’t have anything left to give.” I crawl in next to her and we quietly cry ourselves to sleep as close together and as far apart as we can possibly be.

I don’t speak to Kat for a week when one night she calls. “All or nothing, Jack.”

<p style="text-align: center">

</p>

It’s late at night when I hear about the fire on the news re-running their program from the morning. Kat and I used to make jokes about the brick siding to her apartment because it looked so nice from the outside but so cramped on the inside. She slap the bricks and walk in the decrepit lobby and say, “gold-covered shit!” 

And I’m staring at those bricks but the bricks are black and there are firefighters running inside and Ana tells me to turn down the volume but I can’t hear her because I never called Kat back to tell her those words in my throat. The screen goes black as Ana flips the switch. I can’t find any information online. Ana doesn’t ask why I’m pacing.

I don’t know where I’m going until I get there. I tear the caution tape and start buzzing the buttons until I know nobody will answer; so I start pounding the bricks calling for Kat to come down, if she’d only come down and I could see she was okay. My hands hurt and I’m getting blood all over the place so I stop. Her phone cuts straight to voicemail. I can’t stop sniffing the air, choking on the acrid smokiness. I’m standing next to a big pile of flowers and signs and people are giving me funny looks and Kat isn’t coming down. 

Maybe she made it out okay and took my silence for an answer, and maybe she’s gone, and either way I lost her tonight. I slide down that brick wall and shut my eyes hoping my throat will stop closing up and if it had been daylight someone would have asked to make sure I was okay with the noises I was making but it’s night and it’s late and I’m alone. I shut my eyes and let the world fall to background noise as I hear waves crash over my head.
